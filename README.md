# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project focuses on designing and developing the front-end of an e-learning platform, aimed at providing users with an interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing learning experience. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and front-end development techniques while creating a platform that effectively showcases courses, tracks learning progress, and incorporates multimedia content, including video lessons.

The e-learning platform is structured as a multi-page interface, with a Home Page listing all available courses and individual Course Details pages for each course. The Home Page is designed with a clean and modern layout, featuring a header section that introduces the platform and clearly communicates its purpose. A responsive navigation bar ensures seamless access to all sections, providing users with an intuitive browsing experience. The platform emphasizes accessibility, ensuring that navigation is easy for all users across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

One of the key components of the platform is the course listing section, where users can browse multiple courses. Each course is presented using a card layout, which includes a course title, a representative image, a brief description, and a call-to-action button linking to the course details page. The card-based design not only organizes content neatly but also improves visual appeal and enhances user engagement. Hover effects and subtle animations are incorporated to make the interface interactive and provide visual feedback when users interact with elements.

The Course Details page is designed to provide an immersive learning experience. It features embedded video lessons, ensuring that users can access multimedia content directly from the platform. In cases where videos cannot be embedded due to platform restrictions, clickable links to the video sources are provided, ensuring users can always access the course content without technical issues. A progress tracking bar visually represents a learner’s progress in the course, allowing users to monitor their advancement and maintain motivation. This feature demonstrates practical application of front-end logic combined with visually responsive design elements.

The platform is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes using CSS flexbox, grid layouts, and media queries. All elements, including text, images, buttons, and progress bars, scale proportionally to maintain readability and usability across devices. A consistent color scheme, clean typography, and adequate spacing ensure that the user interface remains aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. The design also emphasizes usability and accessibility by providing clear headings, concise content, and intuitive interaction cues.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to create a professional, interactive front-end for an e-learning platform, combining functional components with modern design principles. The platform effectively
